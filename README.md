title: Habit tracker app


description : This code is an implementation of a habit tracking application using React and Redux toolkit.

The application contains the following components:

App.js: This component is the main component of the application that handles routing between the pages.
Home.js: This component renders the home page of the application that contains the navbar, sidebar, and the habits list.
Addhabit.js: This component renders the page that allows the user to add a new habit to the list.
Habitcontent.js: This component renders the list of habits and their consistency status.
Navbar.js: This component renders the navbar of the application.
Sidebar.js: This component renders the sidebar of the application.
The application uses Redux toolkit to manage the state of the application. The state is stored in a slice called "habit" which contains an array of habit objects. Each habit object contains the title, description, and consistency status of the habit.

The consistency status of a habit is stored in an array of objects, where each object represents a day and contains the status of the habit for that day.

The application allows the user to add a new habit to the list, update the consistency status of a habit for a particular day, and delete a habit from the list.

The application uses React Router to handle routing between the pages, and React hooks like useSelector and useDispatch to access and update the state.
